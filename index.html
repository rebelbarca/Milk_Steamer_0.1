<h3>Personal Information</h3>
  
Oliver Peter Abell (s3903759, s3903759@student.rmit.edu.au)
 
I am Australian. I have completed all senior schooling up to and including finishing year 12. I can speak a little bit of German, though English is my main language.
I am a passionate barista as well as a vivid cricket and AFL player. I've been playing cricket for almost the past decade and AFL for the past 2 years. I've been a barista since August last year.

<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
  
My interest in IT started when I started playing the Xbox Classic. My personal interest with IT is the way that we can fundamentally manipulate everyday appliances/software to do almost anything that you can think of. My interest was sparked by my father and his brother. My experience is IT is a very basic understanding of the fundamentals but have delved into some more advanced things in the recent past.
I chose to go to RMIT as it was one of the best universities for IT/Programming. Recommended to me by my uncle as he was offered a place here when he went to university. I expect to further my knowledge of IT and programming during my studies as I see myself starting my own company once I’ve completed my studies.

<h3>Ideal Job</h3>

The position is asking for a team manager. This position is appealing to me as I have experience as a manager, and it would allow me to further develop my leadership skills and just generally improve as a person.
The required experience for this job requires at least 5-8 years in the IT industry as a general guideline. The requirements that this job is looking for is asking applicants to hold a current and up to date manual drivers license and either a Working with Children’s Check or the ability to pass one as required, as well as having been given the mandated immunisations against Covid-19.
The skills, qualifications, and experience that I have aren't to the standard that this job is looking for. I have less than a years' experience in the IT industry. I've never had leadership experience of an ICT team but I do have some technical knowledge of the technology that they require you to have knowledge of.
The plan I would use to get the requirements for this job would be to spend time in the industry getting experience in a learning capacity and receiving my Working with Children's Check or having the ability to pass one. I’ve already received my mandated immunisation’s against Covid-19. I would be working towards acquiring a current and up to date manual driver’s license

<h3>Personal Profile</h3>

 
What the results of these tests mean to me is that I prefer to learn by doing things by judging how best to get to the outcome.
The results may influence my behaviour in a team as I may agree with what everyone says without giving my own input into the discussion.
When taking the results into account when forming a team, it is best to form a team with those that are compatible with what sort of person you are.

<h3>Project Idea</h3>
Overview
The Milk steamer is a highly intuitive device built for the purpose of teaching trainee baristas to make coffee. The overall objective with this device is to make it a cheap alternative to having a trained barista spend some time training each barista as the device will be able to adapt to the way each person makes coffee. 
Motivation
The Milk Steamer is being designed to help learning baristas improve their coffee making skills. As an experienced barista myself I know what it takes to make a good cup of coffee and when I get a bad cup of coffee, I think what am I able to do to help them become better at their job.
